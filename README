## 🛠 Features

* **Real-Time Ranking:** Automatically sorts agents by total sales amount.
* **Tie-Breaker System:** If sales amounts are equal, the agent with the most "Deals Closed" ranks higher.
* **Clean UI:** Minimalist design using Tailwind CSS, removing heavy icons for faster load times.
* **Auto-Refresh:** The dashboard updates every 30 seconds to show the latest sales without refreshing the page.
* **Indian Currency Format:** Amounts are formatted as per the Indian numbering system (e.g., Rs. 5,00,000).

## 🏗 Project Architecture

The app follows a standard Client-Server model:

1.  **Frontend:** A single HTML file using Vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.
2.  **Backend:** A Node.js and Express API to handle data logic.
3.  **Storage:** Uses JavaScript `Map()` for in-memory data storage (fast and efficient for demos).
